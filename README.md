## My Projects

### Literature

Literature or Canadian Fish is a 6 player card game played in teams of 3. Each team aims to score as many half-sets as possible. The team which scores more half sets wins. I created this multiplayer game using NestJS with GraphQL on server-side and React on client side. I also created a Mobile Application for the same using Ionic.
